    The text you see below is Blackout Poetry 
    using an essay on aesthetics by the Japanese 
    novelist Jun'ichiro Tanizaki. 
    
    <em> In Praise of Shadows</em>, examines our relationship with
    darkness. It is a short but expansive read, covering topics
    as wide-ranging as architecture, lacquer tableware, kabuki actors,
    Albert Einstein, miso soup, and aging. Though rambling at points,
    its guiding thread is the idea that shadows are an essential
    and influential part of Japanese aesthetics.

       There are of course roofs on Western houses too, but they 
       are less to keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and

        built to create
    </span>

    <span class="effect">
        as few shadows as possible and to expose the interior 
       to as much light as possible. If the roof of a Japanese house is a parasol, 
       the roof of a Western house is no more than a cap, 
       with as small a visor as possible so as to allow the sunlight 
       to penetrate directly beneath the eaves. There are no doubt all sorts of reasons-climate, building 
       materials-for the deep Japanese eaves. The fact that we did not use glass, concrete, and bricks, 
       for instance, made a low roof necessary to keep off the 
       driving wind and rain. A light room would no doubt have been more convenient for us, 
       too, than a dark room. The quality that we call beauty, however, must always grow from

        Westerners are amazed at the simplicity of Japanese rooms, 
        perceiving in them no more than ashen walls bereft of 
        ornament. Their reaction is understandable, but it 
        betrays a failure to comprehend the mystery of shadows.

            white glow scarcely varies. And the shadows at the interstices of the
